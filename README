Non-graphical feedback daemon: Droid Vibrator HAL plugin
--------------------------------------------------------

There are two implementations, one using kernel API directly (bypassing HAL)
and one using libvibrator through libhybris.

HAL variant builds against libhybris' libvibrator and libhardware wrappers to
provide haptic feedback for mer-hybris hardware adaptations.
